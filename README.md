* [ ] The exam assignment will have to be zipped in a zip file with name pg5100_<id>.zip
* [ ] replace <id> with the unique id you received with these instructions
* [ ] submit all source codes (eg., .java and .xhtml), and NO compiled code (.class) or libraries (.jar, .war)

      2. Write new review for it, and give a star
          which must lead to a different average. 
      3.Go back to home page. Verify that the average stars for
        that movie has changed.

* [ ] testSorting: 
  1. go to a movie details page, and write 3 reviews with 3 different authors, giving
  different stars. 
  2. Sort the display by time and by stars, and verify it is correctly sorted.




##### Requirements:

* [ ] the delivered project must be compilable with Maven 3.x:
    * [ ] with commands like “mvn package -DskipTests”
  directly from your unzipped file

* [ ] For testing, you can use an embedded database (e.g., H2), or start a real one with Docker (or both). Endto-end tests MUST use Selenium with Chrome.





##### Instructions:

###### Assumptions:
* that the Chrome drivers are
available under the user's home folder (as done in class and in the Git repository)

- docker run -d -u postgres -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password -p 5432:5432 postgres:13
